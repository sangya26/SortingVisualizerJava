# SortingVisualizer-Java GUI Project

## ðŸ“– Introduction

Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project that provides an interactive way to understand different sorting algorithms through a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This tool offers an engaging and educational experience, allowing users to observe the step-by-step execution of popular sorting algorithms in real-time.

## âœ¨ Features

âœ” User-Friendly GUI
Interact with the visualizer through a simple and intuitive Java Swing interface.

âœ” Multiple Sorting Algorithms Supported

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Radix Sort

âœ” Real-Time Visualization
Watch the sorting process as it happens, with elements being compared and swapped in real time.

âœ” Adjustable Speed
Control the speed of the animation to slow down or speed up the visualization based on your learning pace.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Sorting Visualizer project on your local machine:

âœ… 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/sangya26/SortingVisualizerJava.git

cd SortingVisualizerJava

âœ… 2. Open the Project
Use any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) to open the project.

âœ… 3. Compile and Run
Locate the main Java file:

SortingVisualizer.java

Run it to launch the Sorting Visualizer GUI.

## ðŸ–¥ How to Use

Launch the application to open the GUI.
Select a sorting algorithm from the available options (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort).
(Optional) Adjust the speed of the sorting animation using the slider or speed control.
Click the Visualize button to start the process.
Observe the elements being sorted in real time.
Once sorting is complete, experiment with different algorithms or input sizes.
